#	MC Server Checker

# A Short Description About This Bot's Functionality
This bot uses mcapi.us to give us information about a minecraft server given a certain IP and Port combination (IP is required, Port is not, but will default to 25565).

# Configuration File
token: <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications" title="Discord Developer Portal">Discord Developer Portal</a> -> Select your application -> Select the 'Bot' page to copy your token.<br>
clientId: <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications" title="Discord Developer Portal">Discord Developer Portal</a> -> Select your application -> Copy the numbers below 'Application ID'.<br>
guildId: Open Discord -> Settings -> Advanced -> Enable Developer Mode -> Right-Click your guild (server) and click 'Copy ID'.<br>

Paste all of this into 'config-template.json' and after rename it to 'config.json'

# Installing The 'discord.js' Module
Press `Win + R`, run `cmd.exe`, and then `cd` into your project directory.<br>
Now you can install the 'discord.js' module by executing the following line `npm install discord.js`.

# Finally, Running The Bot
Press `Win + R`, run `cmd.exe`, and then `cd` into your project directory.<br>
Firstly, you will need to register the (/) 'Slash' commands by executing `node register-commands.js`.
You can now run the bot by executing `node .` OR `node index.js`.

# DISCLAIMER
